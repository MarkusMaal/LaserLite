set post0=When am I going to release a new video?
set inpost0=You may have noticed that my channel hasn't been really active recently. That's because I've been working on a new PowerPoint OS. It is something big.... Second reason is that I haven't had time to post on YouTube. I hope to get my channel going more active on April.
