		<h2>What is this web page?</h2>
		<p>This webpage replaces my old webpage, that was actually a blog. You can still visit it, but it is used exclusively for blog posts.</p>
		<p>I do not plan to replace Mincraft or Log OS technologies blogs, but MarkusTegelane is definitely replaced with this now.</p>
				<p>Right now, this site can do the following things:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Support for two languages</li>
			<li>List of frequently asked questions from my blog</li>
			<li>Internal and external download links</li>
			<li>Channel list, also from my blog</li>
			<li>Links to different web pages and social profiles</li>
			<li>About page, which shows additional information</li>
		</ul>
